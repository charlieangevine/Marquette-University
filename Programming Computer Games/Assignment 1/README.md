# COSC 3550 - Computer Games
### Assignment #1 
**GOAL**: Write a JavaFX application which displays a picture. The image should be 600 pixels wide by 500 pixels high. Your picture should involve at least two types of shapes (lines, rectangles, ovals, etc.) and at least two colors. Remember, you can find details of what types of shapes, colors, etc. are available by reading the JavaFX API for the GraphicsContext class.
You should use for-loops to draw multiple copies of the shapes, not just a lot of separate draw statements. For instance, you might draw 6 red circles across the bottom and 4 slanting black lines across the applet (using two for-loops), giving something like:

**EXTRA**: As explained in the course syllabus, completing the bare minimum program will earn you a B+ on this assignment. To get a higher grade, you should do something extra to show off. What you do is up to you, but it should demonstrate that you have thought more about your program.

For this assignment, possibilities might include changing the sizes of the shapes across the screen, drawing some fancier pattern, alternating colors, etc.
