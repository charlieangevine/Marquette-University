### Assignment #5 - Implementing a Game (ROUGH DRAFT)

**GOAL**: Produce an initial implementation of the game which you described in Assignment #4.

**METHOD**: Use object-oriented programming techniques in Java to produce a version of your game using JavaFX. You should remember to start simple. Get some pieces of the game working and then expand and improve in small steps.

Grading of the final games will be based more on the quality of programming than on the quality of the graphics or sound. So, make sure your game works well before you spend a lot of time drawing pictures. Remember that if you start out with simple pictures, or even just geometric shapes, you can always replace those later. A game with lots of pictures and music which doesn't detect bullets hitting bad guys and can't react to user input will get a bad grade. A game with simple pictures and no sound which plays well will get a good grade.

For this first draft, you should focus on the basic game play. In other words, you should hand in a playable game, but it's fine if your collision detection isn't as accurate as you'd like, the fonts are bad, you want more "bad guys"/obstacles,... This first version doesn't need to have splash screen, instructions, etc.

In grading this assignment, I'll be looking to see that you have the core functionality of your game working.

### Sprite-based Game

**GOAL**: Produce a final implementation of the game that you described in Assignment #4.

**METHOD**: Expand the rough draft to a complete, polished game. You should have a title page, on-screen instructions, good display of score/status/etc. If appropriate, the game should have more than one level, or have the difficulty change as the game proceeds. It would be good to have some sound effects in the game. There should be a win/loss/game over screen - perhaps a replay option. In other words, the sort of things you find on simple, 2D arcade games.

Even in this final version, grading of the games will be based more on the quality of programming than on the quality of the graphics or sound. So, make sure your game works well before you spend a lot of time drawing pictures. A game with lots of pictures and music that doesn't detect bullets hitting bad guys and can't react to user input will get a bad grade. A game with simple pictures and little sound that plays well will get a good grade.
