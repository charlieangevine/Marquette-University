# COSC 3550 - Computer Games
### Assignment #9 -  3D Models and Interaction with 3D JavaFX

**GOAL**: Write a simple 3D game using JavaFX. It should include user input which controls some interaction with objects in the game, not just moving the camera. You should have at least one object with custom geometry - most likely created with TriangleMesh (like in World3) or by loading an external model (like in ObjModel/World4) The game can be very simple, but there should be some point - some way to win or lose, or points to earn.

**METHOD**: You can display score, win/lose, etc. by simply printing to System.out . If you want to do something a little extra, you could display game status using JavaFX components like Labels, etc.
